# Kendo Challenge Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a full-stack developer. The portfolio is built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **KendoReact** components. It includes several sections such as Home, About, Projects, Testimonials, and Contact.

## Features

- **Home**: A welcoming section with a brief introduction, social links, and buttons to navigate to projects and contact pages.
- **About**: A detailed section showcasing my skills, experience, and professional background.
- **Projects**: A collection of my projects with descriptions, tags, and links to live demos and source code.
- **Testimonials**: Client testimonials with ratings and feedback.
- **Contact**: A contact form and my contact information for easy communication.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **KendoReact**: A suite of UI components for React, including Cards, Buttons, Inputs, and more.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for adding animations and transitions to React components.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: npm is bundled with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chintanonweb/kendo-portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd kendo-portfolio
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

4. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server, and you can view the project in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Available Scripts

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the project for production.
